## Licensing, contributions and maintenance

The code in this repository is licensed under [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), a short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Thus, you're free to fork the project and use the code for your own projects as long as you keep the copyright notices in place.

ThingPulse is committed to open-source development and will continue to maintain this code. We welcome contributions from the community given they are roughly in line with our [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). However, please understand that we primarily developed this application to be run on our own hardware kit mentioned above. It's the only platform we regularly test the code against. You are of course free to run the code on any hardware you think is compatible but you have to rely on community support should you run into problems. 

ThingPulse runs a support forum for its customers that is better suited to answering user questions than the issues list here.
